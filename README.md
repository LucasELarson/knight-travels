#This is a visual representation of a binary search tree sorting algorithm.

Basic functions are as follows: on the left side endter your starting and ending coordinates (with the top being the X and the bottom being Y) then simply hit "GO".
This will show you the fastest way to get from start to end using only knight moves like in chess.

This is an earlier project and as such is not as visually refined.
